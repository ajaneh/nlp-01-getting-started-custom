> Retrieve, process, and visualize text from the web using Python.

## Project Overview

Author: Alex Heyert

Date: 2026 October

First project in the Web Mining and Applied NLP course.
Getting familiar with web scraping and beautiful soup.
The project is configured in
[pyproject.toml](pyproject.toml).

## Data

The example retrieves HTML from a public web page
using the Requests library.

BeautifulSoup parses the HTML and extracts text
for analysis.

No local input dataset is required.

The example uses the TODO:

## Approach

The project uses Python to retrieve and analyze web text.

The example demonstrates:

- Retrieving HTML using HTTP requests.
- Parsing HTML and extracting text with BeautifulSoup.
- Cleaning and normalizing text.
- Counting word frequencies using Polars.
- Visualizing frequent words using Matplotlib.
- Creating word clouds to explore vocabulary patterns.

TODO:

## Run the Project
Go to the [Notebook](notebooks/web_words_heyert.ipynb) if you want to run it yourself!

## Results

The example retrieves web text,
computes word frequencies,
and displays a frequency bar chart and word cloud.

Successful execution produces:

```shell
========================
Pipeline executed successfully!
========================
```

A `project.log` file is created in the project root.

This confirms that the Python analysis executes
and the logging system works.

### Example Visualization

![Word Cloud Example](docs/images/word_cloud_example.png)

## Verification

Run the automated tests:

```shell
uv run python -m pytest
```

## Project Documentation

The [hosted documentation site](https://ajaneh.github.io/nlp-01-getting-started-custom/)
is published using Zensical and GitHub Pages.

The documentation site is used to present the project report,
covering such sections as data, methods, results, visualizations,
interpretation, and conclusions.

## CI/CD and GitHub Actions

This project includes continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD)
to check project files and publish the docs.

GitHub Actions include:

- [CI: Python and Documentation Checks](https://github.com/denisecase/nlp-01-getting-started/actions/workflows/ci-python-zensical.yml)
- [CD: Documentation Deployment](https://github.com/denisecase/nlp-01-getting-started/actions/workflows/deploy-zensical.yml)

## Developer Reference

Follow the
[Professional Python Workflow Guide](https://denisecase.github.io/pro-analytics-02/)
for **detailed instructions and troubleshooting**.

### Initialize and Update the Python Environment

With the project open in VS Code, open a VS Code terminal.
Paste each command and hit Enter or Return after to run it.

```shell
uvx pup-clean --delete
uv self update
uv python pin 3.14
uv python install
uv lock --upgrade
uv sync
uv audit
```

### Set Up and Run Git Hooks

Set up and run the git hooks to perform
basic checks automatically before
any changes get pushed to GitHub.

In the VS Code terminal,
paste each command and hit Enter or Return after to run it.

```shell
uv add prek --dev
uv sync
uv run prek update --freeze --cooldown-days 7

git add -A
uv run prek run --all-files
# repeat if changes were made
uv run prek run --all-files
```

### Run Common Chores

Run linters, formatters, type checks, tests, and
build the documentation.

```shell
uv run ruff check . --fix
uv run ruff format .

uv run ty check
uv run python -m pytest
uv run python -m zensical build
```

### Git add-commit-push to GitHub

After making useful changes, save your work to GitHub.

```shell
git add -A
git commit -m "describe your changes in quotes"
git push -u origin main
```

## Developer Notes

- Use the **UP ARROW** and **DOWN ARROW** in the terminal to scroll through past commands.
- Use `CTRL+f` to find (and replace) text within a file.
